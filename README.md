My completed Java code for the doveloper challenge.

The program is run from the Main.java file and doesnt require any special libaries to run. It (should) work "out of the box".

Input for the program:
The program expects input in the console as descibed in the challenge pdf, with each input argument seperated by a space. 
After each input press enter to procede.
1. Define map size by entering the corodinates for the top-right corner as "X Y" 
2. Enter robot starting location as "X Y ORIENTATION"
3. Enter robot instructions as a continuous string of letters, no spaces.
4. Enter Y to repeat steps 2 and 3 to add more robots. Enter N to finish input.
5. Output will be displayed below in the same console window.
